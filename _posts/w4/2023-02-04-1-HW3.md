## Part 2: Tile design 

Task overview: Write code to generate a 2D [tiling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tile) pattern that could be used for wallpaper or fabric design.  
- A tile is a rectangular design that can be indefinitely repeated and extended. 
	- e.g., using the same tile design, you can make a painting with 1000 x 1000 cells, or 15 x 12 cells. 
- Design something you would want to put on your walls or you would want to wear. We might have a class-wide exhibition for this assignment. 

 If we love your design, you will get <span style="color:#0000ff;"> BONUS (0.1-0.5%)  </span>
###  Task 2.1, sketches <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 1%  </span> 
Look for inspirations online (search for wallpaper/fabric design), and make at least **3**  sketches (manually, or with your ipad/phone/computer, do not code it). Your designs need to follow these rules: 
1. It should be rectangular. There are tiling works with non-rectangular shapes ([e.g., this example](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Garden_Tiles_(7433823224).jpg), and [this](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Dirry_hexagon_tile_at_a_DC_Subway_stop.jpg)), but in this assignment, please stick with rectangular tiles like [this example](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Garden_Tiles_(7433823224).jpg) or [this](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Blue_and_white_Tiles_0027.jpg). 
2. It should have more than 2 colors 
	1. e.g., black + white + gray is fine
3. It's designed for repetition. You are designing one tile to be repeated across your entire wall ([like this example](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Decorative_tiles#/media/File:Geometria.jpg)) instead of designing many unique tiles ([like this example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tile#/media/File:Ganshoren_avenue_Broustin_10_1002.jpg).) However, your tile can change as you repeat them. 
	1. For example, in Vera Molnar's piece: [Transformations(2/18)](https://arthistory.uchicago.edu/happenings/events/rave-zsofi-valyi-nagy-1) , each cell looks slightly different from each other. But the overall look of the tile remains the same. 


What you design is up to you, but here are several suggestions: 

1.  Give consideration to aesthetics of your design. Think about symmetry, rhyme, color, and balance. 
2. Think about how you are tiling your designs. 
	1. Your tile needs to be rectangular, but doesn't need to be a square. e.g., [long tile](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Wall_tiles#/media/File:Azabujuban_station_Oedo_platform_wall_tiles.jpg)
	2. Think about which angle works the best for your design. e.g., [45](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Garden_Tiles_(7433823224).jpg) vs. [90](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Blue_and_white_Tiles_0027.jpg)?
	3. You don't have to tile them in a spreadsheet-like grid. e.g., [long tiles](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Herringbone_bond.svg) 
3.  I recommend start simple. Use many straight lines. If you are designing [an elaborate floral pattern](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Wall_paper_Belville.png) , it might be difficult for you to implement at this stage. It's still good to sketch it down, but I recommend saving these sketches for later. 

**When you finish the sketch, take a picture of it and paste your sketches to your answer sheet.** 

### Task 2.2 turn your sketch into code <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 1.5%  </span>

Create a script as `hw2_part2.py`

Write a script to implement one of your sketches using the [turtle graphics package](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html). 
- The specific implementation is up to you.  But we recommend that you:

1.  develop a function that contains all the instruction needed for one tile 
		- e.g., 
```
def tile(tile_width,tile_height,cell_x,cell_y):
	### implement all actions necessary for drawing a tile at the location of (cell_x,cell_y)
```

 2. write another function that repeat your tile across the row and column. 
	 e.g., 
```
def repeatTiles(column_ct,row_ct):
	# write loops to call the tile function according to the column and row count. 
```
You can watch this 5-min demo video about the [turtle speed setting](https://youtu.be/3sbagh4a7u0), which walks through the turtle.speed() and screen.tracer() functions. Using these functions will help you to speed up the animation. 
 
 After implementing it, run with the following specs:
 1. `column_ct=10,row_ct=10`
 2.  `column_ct=16,row_ct=9`
 3.  `column_ct=100,row_ct=100` # If your hardware can't handle this, use `column_ct=30,row_ct=30`
 
 **Take a screenshot for each of these output. Paste the screenshot to the answer sheet.** 

 


### Task 2.3 Write a paragraph about your design.  <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 0.5%  </span>

In the paragraph, includes  
- The name of your design 
- Description of your design
- Inspiration for your design. 
- Challenges encountered in implementing your design. 

Write the paragraph as a comment in your hw2_part2.py, also paste it to the answer sheet. 

Save your script as `hw2_part2.py`

Tips: 
- The turtle documentation page is your friend. https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html.  Don't limit yourself to functions that we covered in class. 
- It's ok if your generated output looks slightly different from your sketch
