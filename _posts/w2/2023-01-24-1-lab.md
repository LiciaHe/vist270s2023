In this lab, we will work cover information and exercises related to basic coordination systems. 

## Part 1: Coordination Plane Exercise [In-lab] 
### 1.1 Cartesian coordinate system 
In graphics, we will work a lot with [Cartesian coordinate systems.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system) Each point within the coordinate system can be represented by a group of numerical values. 

![1_1_0](../../../assets/w2/w2_coordinate-01.png)
The coordinate of P can be represented as 
```
{"x":50,"y":50}
```
or, simply 
```
(50,50)

# by convention, the order of the coordinate is alphabetically sorted. e.g., if you have X and Y axis, you write the X-axis value before the Y-axis value. 

```
In programming, we often use variables to hold numerical values and expressions. For example, 
```
m=50
n=2*25

#coordinate of point P
P=(m,n)

```

The direction and orientation of the axis is subject to change. When specifying coordinates, it's always important to check the axis labels and the origin. Coordinates could have negative values.  

![1_1_0](../../../assets/w2/w2_coordinate-02.png)

```
1.11 TODO: Write the coordinate for point P and point Q. 

P=(     ,      )
Q=(     ,      )
```

{%comment%}
```
1.11 TODO: Write the coordinate for point P and point Q. 

P=( n, -m ) # direction of Y is reversed. n and m value is different from the previous annotation 
Q=(  -0.75*n   , m )
```
{%endcomment%}


The coordinate system also works in 3D. Always check the direction, origin, and orientation of all axes. 

![1_1_0](../../../assets/w2/w2_coordinate-03.png)

```
#TODO: In the diagram above, write down the coordinates for P0, P1, and P2


P0=(m,0,n )
P1=(    ,      ,      )
P2=(    ,      ,      )
```


{%comment%}

```
#TODO: In the diagram above, write down the coordinates for P0, P1, and P2


P0=(m,0,n )
P1=(0,a,b )
P2=(c,d,0)

```
{%endcomment%}


### 1.2 Working with lines and paths 

In this course, we will call the graphical elements that contains two or more points as **`lines`** or `paths`. We use these two terms interchangably. 


![1_1_0](../../../assets/w2/w2_coordinate-04.png)

```
#TODO: according to the diagram above, write down the coordinates for LINE that contains P0-P1 and the PATH that contains P0 P1 and P2

line_p0p1=((),())
path_p0p1p2=((),(),())
```

Alternatively, you can specify the coordinates for each point first, then group them together to make lines and paths 

```
#TODO: according t the diagram above, write down the coordinates for LINE that contains P0-P1 and the PATH that contains P0 P1 and P2

p0=(,)
p1=(,)
p2=(,)

line_p0p1=(p0,p1)
path_p0p1p2=(p0,p1,p2)

```
{%comment%}

```
#TODO: In the diagram above, write down the coordinates for LINE that contains P0-P1 and the PATH that contains P0 P1 and P2

line_p0p1=((-a,-b),(n,m))
path_p0p1p2=((-a,-b),(n,m),(d,-c))

OR 

p0=(-a,-b)
p1=(n,m)
p2=(d,-c)

line_p0p1=(p0,p1)
path_p0p1p2=(p0,p1,p2)

```
{%endcomment%}



All geometries we work with in this class can be specified as `paths`. For instance, various polygons, simple 3D geometries like cubes and prisms.  



![1_1_0](../../../assets/w2/w2_coordinate-05.png)


In the example above, point P0, P1 and P2 form a 3D path. If this path is closed, it is essencially a plane in the 3D space. 

```
#TODO: according to the diagram above, write down the coordinates for PATH that contains P0 P1 and P2
# pay attention to the axis labels 

path_p0p1p2=((),(),())

```



{%comment%}
```
#TODO: according to the diagram above, write down the coordinates for PATH that contains P0 P1 and P2
# pay attention to the axis labels 

p0=(-m,-n,0)
p1=(0,-b,a)
p2=(-c,0,d)
path_p0p1p2=(p0,p1,p2)

```

### 1.3 Working with Pillow 
We will learn a powerful python-based imaging package called [PILLOW](https://python-pillow.org/) (often called **PIL**).  For the rest of the semester, we will primarily create designs using the PIL package.

#### Task 1.31 Creating and saving images using PIL
  
To use the PIL package, you need to import the PIL module. Because the PIL module has multiple submodules, we will only import parts that are relevant to us.   
  
  
In your `hw6_part1.py`, write the following import statement.   
  
  
```  
from PIL import Image, ImageDraw  
```  
  
- If you have installed Anaconda, PIL is likely to be installed along with your anaconda.   
- If you have not installed PIL, please follow [this installation guide](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html)  
  
  
There are multiple ways to create images using the PIL package. We will use the `Image.new()` method ([doc](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.new)).  
  
The PIL.Image.new() method takes 3 values: mode, size, and color.   
  
`mode` indicates the type of image you are generating. According to the [documentation](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/handbook/concepts.html#concept-modes):  
![](../../../assets/w7/Pasted image 20220225171536.png)  
  
The most relevant modes we will use in this class includes:  
- 1: black and white images:  
   -  you only have two color values: 0 is black, 1 is white.   
- L: grayscale images:  
   - you have the full 256 grayscale intensities. 0 is the darkest, 1 is the lightest     
- RGB: colored image with RGB value   
- HSV: a colored image that uses Hue, Saturation, and Value.   
  
`size` is a 2-tuple that contains the width and height of the image in pixels.   
e.g.,   
```  
  
width=300  
height=300  
size=(width,height)  
  
```  
  
`color` is the default color to use for the image. By default, the image is black.   
  
to show an image, use the `PIL.Image.show()` command.   
  
e.g.,   
```  
from PIL import Image,ImageDraw    
    
    
width=300  height=300  size=(width,height)    
    
img=Image.new("L",size,0) #store the created image into a variable called img img.show() #show this image   
```  
  
To save an image, use `Image.save()` method:   
  
Image library provides powerful image exporting utilities. [Read to the documentation here](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.new) to learn more about the `Image.save()` method.  [This document](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/handbook/image-file-formats.html) lists all the possible export options.   
  
In summary, you save an image by calling:  
  
  
```  
#img is a variable that holds your image #save_addr is a variable that holds the location and name of your output #e.g., save_addr="c:/test/test_img.png"  
# if save_addr only contains image name, e.g., save_addr="test.jpg", # then your image will be stored in the same location of your python script.   
  
img.save(save_addr)  
```  


#### Task 1.32: Draw any path with Pillow 


## Part 2: Drawing with Pillow

## Task 2.1: Replicate a line 


**Task:** write a function to generate RGB images with a random size and a random background. The width and height of the image range from 300 pixels to 700 pixels. When you finish generating the image, your function will save the image in a given location.   
  
i.e., implement the following function   
  
```  
def create_random_canvas(width_range,height_range,save_loc,save_name):  
   '''   create an image with random size and background color   :param width_range: a list of 2 numerical values that determine the range of the canvas width.   :param height_range: a list of 2 numerical values that determine the range of the canvas height.   
   :param save_loc: location where the created image will be stored   
   :param save_name: name (and file extension) of the image to be saved  
   '''   ##TODO   
```  
  
When running the following line:  
```  
create_random_canvas([300,700],[300,700],"","test.jpg")  
```  
  
Your function should create an image with random background color and size and store it as "test.jpg" in the location where your python script is stored.   
  
  
#### Task 1.32 Drawing a rectangle in PIL  
  
In PIL, the `ImageDraw` module provides drawing utilities to create graphics. To create a rectangle, you have multiple options:  
1. You can use `ImageDraw.line()` to create 4 lines [doc here](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/ImageDraw.html#PIL.ImageDraw.ImageDraw.line).   
2. Or `ImageDraw.polygon()` [doc](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/ImageDraw.html#PIL.ImageDraw.ImageDraw.polygon)  
  
Your goal is to implement a function so that given an image and settings for a rectangle, your function will generate a rectangle on your image.   
  
i.e., implement the following image   
  
```  
  
def draw_rect(img,x,y,w,h,color=(0,0,0),filled=False):  
   '''   create a rectangle on the given image   :param x:top left corner  
   :param y: top left corner   :param w   :param h   :param color: stroke and fill color   :param filled: determine if the rectangle is filled or not.   
   :return img with the rectangle   
   '''  
   ##TODOreturn img   
```  
  




## Part 2: 


### Task 1.33 Implement a grid layout system in PIL 
In previous labs and homework, we have implemented grid-based layouts multiple times. In this task, implement a grid-layout function that generates a square grid according to different settings.   
  
i.e.,   
  
```  
def grid_layout(col_ct,row_ct,cell_size,margin):    
    '''   
   Create an image that contains a grid layout.   
     
    :param col_ct:  
    :param row_ct:    :param cell_size: width and height of the cell    :param margin:  
    :return: img object that contains the grid drawing    '''   #todo ```  
  
After implementation, calling the following lines:  
  
```  
img=grid_layout(3,3,40,20)  img.show()  
```  
  
would generate an image similar to this   
  
![](../../../../assets/w7/Pasted image 20220225181842.png)  
  
  
### Task 1.4 Generate a rectangle tile design <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 0.5%  </span>  
  
  
Implement a simple 1-rectangle tile design with the following spec:  
1. In each cell, there exist one rectangle.   
![](../../../../assets/w7/Pasted image 20220225183022.png)  
2. The color and size of the rectangle can be random   
   1. e.g., ![](../../../../assets/w7/Pasted image 20220225183156.png) and ![](../../../../assets/w7/Pasted image 20220225183239.png) are both possible results.   
2. When the layout setting changes (i.e., col_ct, row_ct, cell_size), your function should still work.   
   1. e.g., your function should be able to generate similar images like this one
